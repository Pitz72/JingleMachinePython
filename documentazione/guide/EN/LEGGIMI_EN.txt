          RUNTIME RADIO LIVE MACHINE PRO - v1.4.1 Public Beta
================================================================================

Thank you for downloading Runtime Radio Live Machine Pro.

This application is a professional "Digital Cartwall", designed for radio directors,
podcasters, and streamers who need to trigger audio assets (jingles, effects, beds)
with zero latency during live broadcasts.

WHAT IS IT AND WHAT DOES IT DO?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike a standard music player, this software is optimized for:
1. SPEED: Sounds start the exact instant you press the button.
2. RELIABILITY: Works offline and saves everything locally.
3. CONTROL: Supports external MIDI keyboards for a "physical" feel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 88 PROGRAMMABLE PADS: A fully customizable 8x11 grid.
* DRAG & DROP: Drag your MP3/WAV files directly onto the keys.
* MIDI INTEGRATION: Connect your controller (e.g., Launchpad, Korg NanoPad) and
  use the "MIDI Learn" function to assign sounds to physical keys.
* ADVANCED PLAYBACK MODES:
  - Restart: Restarts the sound from the beginning (ideal for effects).
  - Continue: Pause/Resume (ideal for beds and speech).
  - Overlay: Overlays the same sound (ideal for drums/rapid effects).
* PRO INTERFACE: Dark themes to avoid eye strain in the studio.
